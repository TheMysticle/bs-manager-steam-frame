# How to install BSManager on the Steam Frame

This fork runs on the Steam Frame (ARM64 SteamOS). Installing it takes one command:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/DaVarga/bs-manager/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

It installs BSManager to `~/Applications/BSManager.AppImage`, adds it to the app menu (a `.desktop`
entry with icon), and lets BeatSaver's **OneClick** buttons open it. BSManager then updates itself.

There are two ways to run the command. On the Frame itself you type with the on-screen keyboard.
From a PC over SSH you can use a real keyboard, or just paste.

## Before you start

- Beat Saber in your Steam library.
- **Proton 11.0 (ARM64)** installed. Steam installs it the first time you start a Windows game;
  otherwise install it from the library (Tools).

## Option A: on the Frame, with the on-screen keyboard

1. In VR, open the dashboard and click **+** in the bar at the bottom. A **Launch program** list
   opens. Choose **Konsole** (the terminal).

2. Click the **keyboard icon** under the Konsole window to open the on-screen keyboard.
3. Type the command above exactly and press Enter. Watch out for:
   - `-fsSL`: capital `S` and `L`
   - `|`: the pipe character before `bash`
   - no spaces inside the address

   If the command is open in a browser on the Frame, copy it there and use Konsole's **Paste**
   button (top right) instead of typing it.
4. When it prints `done`, close Konsole. **BSManager** is now in the same **Launch program** list.

## Option B: from your PC over SSH

Set this up once on the Frame:

1. **Settings → System → Enable Developer Mode.**
2. In the developer settings, set a **password** for the `steamos` user. SSH is then available.

Then on your PC, open **PowerShell** (Windows 10/11 ships `ssh`) or a terminal (Linux, macOS) and
connect:

```sh
ssh steamos@frame
```

Depending on your network, the Frame is reachable as `frame`, `frame.lan` or `frame.local`. If
none of them works, use its IP address from your router, for example `ssh steamos@192.168.1.56`.

Answer `yes` to the fingerprint question the first time and enter the password. Then run the
install command:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/DaVarga/bs-manager/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

When it prints `done`, BSManager is in the Frame's **Launch program** list (see Option A, step 4).

## Native ARM64 Beat Saber

BSManager runs the x64 version of Beat Saber through emulation. For **1.44.1** it can install a
native ARM64 build instead, which needs less than half the CPU time per frame:

1. Download or select Beat Saber **1.44.1** in BSManager. To keep the x64 version too, work on a
   copy: gear menu at the top right → **Clone**.

2. Open the **ARM64** tab next to Mods and click **Install**. Keep **Mod support (BSIPA)** checked to
   use mods.

3. When the log ends with `done`, the version is native. Launch it as usual. **Reinstall** after a
   Proton update, and **Uninstall** puts the x64 files back.

Tip: turn off **Adaptive SFX** (Solo → song selection → **Player Settings** tab next to the song
list). On ARM64 its loudness measurement is expensive and makes frame times less steady.

Tip: turn off **Screen Distortion** in the game's graphics settings. It costs a lot of GPU time on the
Frame, and bs-arm64 v0.1.6 shows frozen ghost images with it on.

Foveated rendering: open Beat Saber in your **Steam** library → ⚙ → **Properties** → **Performance** and
turn on **Foveated Rendering**. BSManager reads that switch and starts the native version with
eye-tracked foveated rendering: the area you look at
is rendered at full resolution and the edges at lower resolution, which saves GPU time and battery.
Eye tracking needs bs-arm64 0.2.0 or later; 0.1.7 uses a fixed profile instead.

## Update or remove

- **Update:** BSManager offers updates itself. Running the install command again also updates.
- **Remove:**
  ```sh
  curl -fsSL https://github.com/DaVarga/bs-manager/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash -s -- --uninstall
  ```
  Your versions, maps and settings in `~/.local/share/BSManager` stay.
